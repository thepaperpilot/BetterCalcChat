A Better CalcChat client.

[Download Client! (.jar)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4xCmMA9eS2jZXhzcHpDc25zdzQ/view?usp=sharing)

Note: This is a stand-alone application. 
If you'd prefer to stay within your browser, there is [this very nice chrome extension by Hardy Creations](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/calc-chat-cleanup/ghbaoonbpgameecbhgmlcomljjdikbln?hl=en-US). 
If you use another browser, the best you're going to get is [this userstyles script](https://userstyles.org/styles/86113/calcchat-reflowed). Use with Stylish or equivalent.

Current features:
- View the problems of an entire section at once
- Zoom into problems much more than calcchat's web client

Upcoming features:
- Add precal and applied textbooks
- Save images locally
- Chrome extenstion? Greasemonkey script? Android app?
