A Better CalcChat client.

Download the client on [the releases page](https://github.com/thepaperpilot/BetterCalcChat/releases)

Note: This is a stand-alone application. 
If you'd prefer to stay within your browser, there is [this very nice chrome extension by Hardy Creations](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/calc-chat-cleanup/ghbaoonbpgameecbhgmlcomljjdikbln?hl=en-US). 
If you use another browser, the best you're going to get is [this userstyles script](https://userstyles.org/styles/86113/calcchat-reflowed). Use with Stylish or equivalent.

Current features:
- View the problems of an entire section at once
- Zoom into problems much more than calcchat's web client

Upcoming features:
- Animate images in as they load (fade in and move up, animation reference: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/timer.html)
- Add precal and applied textbooks
- Save images locally
- Browser extensions? Greasemonkey script? Android app?

Screenshots:
_(Note: I'm using linux, and have a GTK+ theme applied to my java applications. The program uses your system's default LaF.)_
