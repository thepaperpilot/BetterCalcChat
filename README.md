A Better CalcChat client.

Download the client on [the releases page](https://github.com/thepaperpilot/BetterCalcChat/releases)

Note: This is a stand-alone application. 
If you'd prefer to stay within your browser, there is [this very nice chrome extension by Hardy Creations](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/calc-chat-cleanup/ghbaoonbpgameecbhgmlcomljjdikbln?hl=en-US). 
If you use another browser, the best you're going to get is [this userstyles script](https://userstyles.org/styles/86113/calcchat-reflowed). Use with Stylish or equivalent.

This client is superior to the calcchat website because it can:
- Show you an entire section's problems at once
- Zoom into images better
- Navigate between images, chapters, sections, and books better

_(Note: I'm using linux, and have a GTK+ theme applied to my java applications. The program uses your system's default LaF.)_
